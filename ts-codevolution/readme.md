# TypeScript

#### Why TS?
* With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.
* Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocompletion.
* Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.
